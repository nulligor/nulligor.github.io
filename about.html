<p style="margin-top: -25px">Since writing about yourself is pretty hard and I was told to start with a punchline of some sort, here you go. This is the very citation that could be said
to be my all time favorite.</p>
<p>
	I'm 28, live in São Paulo - BR, been programming since I was 17, focus on web technologies and back-end engineering.
	<br/>
	When I'm not studying I usually read sci-fi books, watch shows from the land of the rising sun (and some western ones),
	try to play some games and listen to some weird music nobody actually cares about.

	<strike>I am currently employed as Back-end Engineer at <a href ="https://www.pipefy.com/pt-br/" target="_blank">Pipefy</a></strike>
	<br/>
	I also used to attend to Math University (UNESP - BR) and Business/IT (FATEC - BR).
	<br/>
        <br/>

	Curiously, all of my interest regarding code started off back in 2007 when I had to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmod" target="_blank">softmod</a>
	some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS" target="_blank">Nintendo DS</a> games that I owned in order to play them in english.
</p>
<p>And I haven't stopped thinking about code ever since...</p>

<p>  I have been specializing in Ruby on Rails and other MVC Frameworks such as Django (Python) and Spring Boot (Java). My latest work is contractor work and I'm open to new positions!  </p>
