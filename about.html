<p style="margin-top: -25px">Since writing about yourself is pretty hard and I was told to start with a punchline of some sort, here you go. This is the very citation that could be said
to be my all time favorite.</p>
<p>
	I can't really say if it tells a lot about me though (lol).
	<br/>
</p>
<p>
	I'm 23, live in São Paulo - BR, been programming since I was 17, focus on web technologies and back-end engineering.
	<br/>
	When I'm not eagerly digging deep into studying new tech I usually read sci-fi/philosophy books, watch shows from the land of the rising sun,
	discuss and think about the social aspects of coding or listen to some weird music nobody actually cares about.
	<br/>
	<strike>I am currently employed as Mobile Sofware Developer at <a href ="http://www.commandalkon.com/" target="_blank">Command Alkon.</a></strike>
	<br/>
	I am currently employed as Back-end Engineer at <a href ="http://www.petlove.com.br/" target="_blank">Pet Love.</a></strike>
	<br/>
	I also used to attend to Math University (UNESP - BR) and Business/IT at (FATEC - BR) but now I'm eager to re-think my possibilities in any specialized STEM curriculum.
	<br/>
	As for fun I read books and ride bikes (now more occasionaly than ever...). Sometimes I take risks and try out some new game here and there
	(even though nowadays I tend to be particularly grumpy towards new games).
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Strangely enough, all of my interest regarding code started off back in 2007 when I had to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmod" target="_blank">softmod</a>
	some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS" target="_blank">Nintendo DS</a> games that I owned in order to play them in english.
</p>
<p>
	And I haven't stopped thinking about code ever since...
